			Hi, folks:) Let me introduce myself. My mane is Tania, I am 24 years old, and I like sunny people and funny stories! 
			</p>
			<p>
			So, I was born at small town Radekhiv in Lvivska region. In a childhood I was a very restless child, my parents always had to look closely to me. But when I grew up I became more calm and balanced person. I finished a school in Radekhiv and decided to continue my studying in Lviv Academy of Commerce. 
			</p>
			<p>
			It was a new page in my life. During my studying in the academy I have found a lot of friends. Some of them became my best friend, and we still are keeping in touch. My students years were a very happy and funny times. I with my groupmates liked to spend time together. We liked to celebrate some holidays in Carpathian Mountains, and some funny stories I  will remember to long times:) Although, my students years were special for me, because I’ve met my future husband Andrew:)
			</p>
			<p> 
			After finishing the academy we got married:) It was a small celebration in Lviv with our dearest people. After that we were traveling during some period. We have visited Italy, Norway, Poland and some others European countries. Inspired from this adventure I decided to start a new part in my life and this life is connected with IT. 
			</p>
			<p> 
			So, I decided to try myself in software testing. I think, this direction is for me, because I like so much quality things. I like doing all kind of work according to some plan. I like working in team. Like learning something new and doing something which might have gain for other people. My main goal is working hard for a good result. After a very hard and long period of studying I started working in the best company in the world “GlobalLogic” as a QA engineer:) 
I am very happy in my new position. I like my work, my team, my company. Every day is a very interesting for me and I see a directions to develop myself and to improve my professional skills!
